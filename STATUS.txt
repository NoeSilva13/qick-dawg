THINGS THAT NEED TO GET DONE 

- Upload to GitHub -- by 10/31
- Submit Joss paper -- by 10/31

- Run through installation once more -- 98% sure it should work with no changes (AM)

- Check through the functionality once more -- run jupyter notebook (AM) or (ER) 

- Do we have automated tests for users to test functionality?
	- Should we just link to the QICK loop back test?

-Software paper -- (ER) will review and edit this 
	-Summary for diverse non specialist audience
	-Statement of need
	-State of the field 

-Modify the hardware readme to include the ZCU111?
-Modify the voltage divider in the hardware readme to match our current version

- Setup.py and SPHINX documentation (ER/AM)
________________________________________________________________________

TO DO SOONER THAN LATER

- setup a diamond/laser/mw/FPGA setup so we can test the functionality
- (ER) meet with Jasmine talk about SPINX and setup.py 
- Need to update the voltage divider from my old version to the new version and get pictures

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

-Do we have automated tests for users to test functionality?
-What do we want to put under the hardware section? I added a shortened list from the hardware readme that I have archived
-Under project status do we want to say that a hardware setup/readme will be coming soon?
-How do we want to credit Sho? Right now we just say thank you to Sho on the main readme page.
-I had to add config.mw_readout_delay_treg to Readoutwindow in 4x2demo--I'm not sure what it should be set to can you check on this?
-I had to config.laser_readout_offset_treg=310 ## ER HAD TO ADD THIS to 4x2
-I had to mw_readout_delay and laser_readout_offset to Hahn echo 
- Are we making functionality claims -- part of the JOSS paper. I think this would be related to the overhead in timing
-Do we want to edit the installation to make sense for 4x2 and 111 users?
	-this would mean sectioning off the balun surgery for onyl 4x2 users
	-incuding a schematic setup for 111 users

MOVE THINGS HERE WHEN THEY ARE COMPLETED 

- Add licensing to readme (ER) DONE 10/14
	- added the SANDIA text required before the OSS license
	- used the MIT license template from GITHUB for the rest of the text
	- I compared this to software on the sandia github and ours looks good
	- this is in both the readme and its own license text document
- ER edited main page readme and feels like its done 10/14
	- edited the wording of the abstract
	- changed the hardware section
	- added the proper licensing 
- went through and implemented AM comments in the main readme and installation read me 10/15 
- went through the pulse sequence plotting and adjusted the vars_on plots so that the text is readable 10/15
- 10/16 made some quick qickdawg timing analysis code--runs through each sequence for a range of reps and then does a linear fit on the data
  Right now I'm thinking that the y intercept is the overhead time for any run regardless of the reps 
  There might be fancier things we could do to add to the analysis like comparing the pusling time to the actual time it takes to run, but
  I feel like this would only show the relax delay time and its already clear from the documentation what/how long that is 
  ** I should re run this notebook with the correct settings for mw_readout_delay_treg and laser_readout_offset --> not sure what they should be

WHEN THE GITHUB IS POSTED CHANGE THESE THINGS

- need to redo the internal links to other files
